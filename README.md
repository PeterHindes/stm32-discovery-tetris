# stm32-discovery-tetris
This project is essentially full Tetris with the exception of the scoring which only scores based on row clears and not any of the other official Tetris scoring methods. It uses fully touch screen based input with the exception of full drops which use the button. There are additional configuration compile switches which make it more closely match the grading criteria including making the button rotate the piece instead of drop it and change the timing of the automatic drops.

This code should be good to go if you just compile and upload it directly to the STM 32 discovery one (DISC-1) board. It's blue and has an LCD which the game is played on.
